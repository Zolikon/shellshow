# Features

- Each `# H1` heading starts a new slide — the title is rendered as ASCII art.

- Supported blocks: headings, paragraphs, lists, code (syntax highlighted), tables, alerts, and dividers.
- Not supported markdown blocks: quetes, images
- Extended support: basic pixalarts
- Block styling via inline metadata comments.
  - alignment
  - color
  - font style
- Optional project-level metadata (title, author, date, table of contents, default colour scheme).
  - title: when defined a title page is generated as the first slide, displaying author and date to if present
  - table of content: if set true then a table of content page is generated by based on all the slides to-be-displayed
  - colod theme: can define presentation-level background color and text color (this can be overriden on elements)
- Help that can be used as a prompt for presentation generation
- Shortcuts for quick navigation
- Screenshot during presentation
- Presentation only mode

## Font size

This is a terminal-based application so setting font size must happen within the terminal window itself. Application will be using that.

# Why use it?

- Retro style
- Lightweight, runs in any terminal. Only python (and uv) is needed
- Easy switching to other screen during presentation
- Presentation can be generated by any LLM, help can be copied as a prompt
- Works with any markdown, including project README.md files. Can be used as an easy-to-consume tutorial. Just try it with this readme:

```bash
uv run python main.py README.md
```
